                Bee City is a program that promotes awareness of native bees and their importance
                as pollinators. Xerces is the conservation group that started Bee City USA. Cities
                in the United States can become a Bee City by upholding the various efforts as a
                city or committee that meet the standards found at
                <a href="https://www.beecityusa.org/what-is-a-bee-city.html" target="_blank">Bee City USA</a>.

                My conservation biology class started the process in Eau Claire by contacting the
                city council, organizing functions, gaining public support, and gathering names for
                a committee. This process can take extensive time to get all the requirements in
                order but we began that process for future classes to continue. I did extensive
                projects in an entomology class doing research on bees and their importance as
                pollinators to various habitats.

                As pollinators, bees enhance genetic diversity of plants that we use for medicine
                and food. Because of the benefits of bees that we now rely on, they have become vital
                to the survival of many flora and fauna species because of their role, mainly as a
                pollinator, in the many intricate food webs that sustain our planet. Bees are important
                and need conservation efforts to educate the public on how the benefits outweigh the scary
                misconceptions some people believe.
