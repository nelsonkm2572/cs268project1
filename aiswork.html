                Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) affect our waters more than many realize.
                They often start as microscopic organisms that travel out of their native
                habitat and into a habitat where they commonly take over and starve the native
                species of their resources. AIS often don't have natural predators, thus
                allowing them to thrive in the new environments. AIS can be species such as
                Zebra Mussels, Spiny Water Flee, Eurasian Watermilfoil, and Asian Carp. Species
                such as these can wreak havoc on the aquatic ecosystem, recreational activities,
                and agriculture, which costs the United States millions of dollars each year.

                Clean Boats Clean Waters (CBCW) is funded all over the United States in order to
                protect inland bodies of water. The watercraft inspectors go through training
                to correctly work with the public, give proper information to boaters, and how to
                record the data received. The data is then entered on the SWIMS database, where the DNR and
                other organizations have access to look at it. This data specifically shows where boaters are
                going to and from, the spread of AIS, and even tourism. This information is useful to track
                AIS and the impact they have on lakes. By informing the public, it lets them know their part and
                how they can prevent the spread of AIS.

                I worked for CBCW for 4 years. I started off in Vilas County, working for UW-Oshkosh
                as part of their CBCW efforts in Northeastern Wisconsin. For the last 3 years, I worked
                on Lake Wissota at the Chippewa Rod and Gun boat launch in Chippewa Falls as a watercraft
                inspector for CBCW. There I educated the public on AIS, collected and compiled data for
                the SWIMS database, and monitored the boat launch. This work included teaching people of
                all ages about what AIS are, their impact on bodies of water and how to prevent them, and
                the laws associated with AIS in the state of Wisconsin. I also ran campaigns to promote
                boaters draining their live wells and cleaning their boat between lakes. By handing out
                free things like stickers, ice packs, and towels it helped push the message of preventing the
                spread of AIS while engaging the boat launch patrons.
