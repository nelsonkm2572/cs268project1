            <h1>Prairie Burn</h1>
            <p>
                Before being able to join in any burn, I had to undergo a course on prairie burning
                and get a certificate for basic prairie burns in the state of Wisconsin. After this
                course was taken, UW-Eau Claire was set to have its own burn to promote the health
                of the native prairie along Little Niagara Creek on the UW-Eau Claire campus, a
                controlled burn of vegetation on the creekâ€™s banks. It was conducted the morning of
                Sunday, April 28 with the help of a prairie restoration team. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The controlled burn helped kill off invasive species and allowed prairie species to
                thrive as they start growing that spring. Native prairie plant seeds were also spread
                immediately after the burn to promote that growth. Prairie burns occur naturally and
                often act as catalysts for many plant species to start germination. This burn promoted
                a natural process and rejuvenation of native plant species.
            </p>
            <p>
                This burn offered me hands on experience in participating in a controlled burn with
                professionals and the opportunity to carry out many aspects in the burn. These aspects
                include individually burning a quadrant of the prairie and also using a hose to smother
                smoldering vegetation in another quadrant.
