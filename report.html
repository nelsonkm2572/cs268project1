                    After working with Mr. Nelson, he has exceeded my expectations. I figured this would be a simple site with a 
                    main page and a resume page but he turned it into more. The use of pictures and my experiences were more than 
                    I could have asked for. I can honestly say that I will be using this website for future employers so they can 
                    see that I am more than a person on paper. It brings to life my experiences and will make me stand out from 
                    other applicants. This may have just been a project for him, but it feels like he did a service that I would 
                    pay for. 
                </p>
                <p>Thank you,</p>
